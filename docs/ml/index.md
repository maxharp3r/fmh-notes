# Machine Learning Notes

Resources:

* Coursera: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
  <https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome>
* ML + latex: <https://blmoistawinde.github.io/ml_equations_latex/>

## Loss functions

* loss function ($L$): one example vs. cost function ($J$): training set
    * q: which terminology for mini-batch?

### log loss

$$
-{(y\log(p) + (1 - y)\log(1 - p))}
$$

## Backprop
